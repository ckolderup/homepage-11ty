This site was built in 2025. It's the fifth major version of my "homepage" at this particular domain.

It was built using Eleventy!
The font is Public Sans.
I used icons by Fabio Nucatolo from The Noun Project, if I ever got around to building that cool front page that I was thinking I should.

Here's what it looked like last time:

<img src="/broken.svg" style="height: 32px; aspect-ratio: 1/1; background-color: white; padding: 8px; border: 4px ridge">
<div class="caption">okay I didn't make the screenshot yet this is a broken image icon</div>
