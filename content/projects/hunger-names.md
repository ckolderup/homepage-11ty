Hunger Names was a cast-off project thrown together by me and my friends Keith and John. I was part of the group chat that was kind of riffing on the original joke ("the names of people in the Hunger Games series are funny") and then helped write a bunch of the different pieces of text that are loaded into the random generator that runs on the site. I don't host the project and (if I recall correctly) wasn't involved in the coding at all! We just kind of slapped it together for fun one day and then watched in mild bafflement as it went fairly viral on Twitter and got written up on a variety of lifestyle blogs. Oops!
