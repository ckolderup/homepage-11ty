My personal blog has been hosted at https://motd.co since sometime in the mid 2010s. I've been sporadically active on it over the years; it's always something I wish I did more but haven't always been successful at making time for it. I've merged my Tumblr and Cohost archives into the full post archive, with little verification and varying degrees of brokenness. I have syndicated a selection of some of my favorite pieces from that site here in the [Writing](/writing) section.
