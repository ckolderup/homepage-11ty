With [the end of Glitch](https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch) in 2025, like all of its users, I had to find a new home for all of the projects that I had been using the site to host. My friend and fellow Glitch engineer [Keith](https://keith.is) had started working earlier that year on a system that would provide to a single use some of the easy hosting setup of Glitch without all of the container infrastructure and security necessitated by a site running user-generated code for millions of strangers. I messed with it a bit and got most of the projects I cared about ported over in a functional state. Many of the projects over there are documented on this site, but a few aren't!
