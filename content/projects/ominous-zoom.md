I've decided to give Ominous Zoom its own page because it's my favorite of all of my Twitter bots. (You can read about a lot of the others on [the catch-all page for that era of work](/projects/misc-twitter-bots)) Ominous Zoom used a very early and barely-trained form of facial recognition to attempt to zoom in on faces that it found in images from the Wikimedia archive, first in the form of four static images of increasing zoom level, then eventually posting periodically with videos that zoomed in while playing tense audio samples it would generate by taking a few different violin-heavy mp3s that I had and running them through a ["Paulstretch"](https://www.paulnasca.com/algorithms-created-by-me#h.4c6i2abbt3xk) filter. It found faces with varying levels of successes, which led to a lot of pretty funny outcomes.

I did port the bot to Mastodon, using the botsin.space instance, and to my Discord art bot gallery _Scrumwave_, but shut it down along with all of my other bots a little while ago.
