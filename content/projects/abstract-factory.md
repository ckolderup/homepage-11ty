Abstract Factory was a podcast I made with my friend Mark Wunsch. We wanted to have some time to discuss specific concepts in technology and learn a bit about the process of recording and producing a finished audio thing, so we did it for a little while! I really enjoyed making it and we were lucky to get sweet opening and closing themes from our friends Joe and Liam.
