Backtracks Radio uses the ICEcast software to stream music via a .m3u playlist file into a simple `&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;` tag with a nice-looking webpage that my friend Liam designed and then I restyled using a new photo and color scheme. The result is a website that you can go to at any time and hear some songs I think are good and "go well" together, whatever that means.

The stream itself also embeds okay, it turns out!
