description: a free website to keep track of scores in a game
---

I built scoreboard.website in 2020 in order to learn a bit of React (and create-react-app) and to refresh my memory on how to use Redis + websockets to make a website "live" with ephemeral data. The site lets you create a "scoreboard" where you can manage a number of "players" and their current "score". It provides a backend where you manage the scores and a separate frontend where the scores are displayed and is styled to look vaguely like the scores screen on the British TV show "Taskmaster" because I used this as a tool for a live "Taskmaster"-style livestream I ran with a bunch of friends over the holidays in December 2020.
