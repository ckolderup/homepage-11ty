Amplifier had two different forms but the core concept remained the same: recommending new music to friends, looking to make them aware of big releases from bands they already knew but also exposing them to new stuff that I thought deserved more attention. It started as an email newsletter, migrated across a few different providers, then eventually got rebuilt in 2021 as a progressive web app that shared Instagram story-like clips of songs. I'd like to revisit this eventually-- it was a lot of work to build new updates for the site, so I'd want to focus this time on streamlining the process of going from "a list of songs I want to highlight" to a finished "update", including sending out email updates and (since browsers have added support since 2021) push notifications when new recommendations are available.
