Since I was a teenager I've been fascinated with Nethack, one of the first true "roguelikes" in video games. The problem being that I'm not actually all that good at it? I've never really mastered the game. I decided that maybe that combination of enthusiasm and lack of skill might make for entertaining viewing, so I streamed Nethack on Twitch for a little while, archiving the twice-weekly streams on YouTube. There's about 60 hours of Nethack recorded-- I found it an interesting exercise to manage the streaming software and the responsibilities of being the channel host. And you should play Nethack!
