I was lucky to get to play a prototype of the party game [Wavelength](https://www.wavelength.zone/) before it was Kickstarted via friends who were all part of the [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com) community. Wavelength had a successful launch, I bought copies for all of my family and friends as Christmas gifts that year, and I thought that was pretty much it. Then I was approached by Alex, one of the designers, with a request: the team had been manually posting on their Twitter account with a sample from one of the cards in the Wavelength deck and asking community members to make suggestions about what would make a good clue for that dial position. Would it be possible for me to create an automated version of that process, including announcing a daily winner based on who got the most likes?

I set about working on this; I had made Twitter bots that posted static content on a schedule and some that responded to simple @mentions on Twitter, but combining the two added a bit of complexity. The bot was written in Ruby and used a big pool of pre-generated cards delivered to me by the Wavelength Team. It was really fun to get to work with some of my favorite tabletop designers and have a bit of a hand in building community around such a cool game!
