I made a tool to stitch screenshots of games built in the ZZT Game Creation System together into "maps" like you might see in Nintendo Power and wrote up a tiny bit about some of the challenges/assumptions that made the tool imperfect, but then shared a big selection of games for which it worked pretty nicely.
