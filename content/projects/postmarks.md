You can read more about Postmarks in its [announcement post on my blog](https://motd.co/2023/09/2740464/):

> Postmarks aims to provide a few different functions. Those functions are:
>
> 1. Tag-indexed bookmarking
> 2. ActivityPub publishing (soon to be optional!)
> 3. Simple commenting, also powered by ActivityPub (also optional)
>
> It's inspired by a number of websites I've loved over the years, including del.icio.us, Google Reader, and Branch.
