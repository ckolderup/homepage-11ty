## About Me

Hi! I'm Casey Kolderup. I live in Portland, OR, USA. I'm a software developer, a music lover, and a fan of art that can fit a mystery or a puzzle into it. I like making things, writing, and trying out new restaurants. I have a deep love for the 1996 film _Big Night_, the Super Nintendo game _Earthbound_, and the songs of Jason Molina.

I'm also... looking for full-time work! _(pulls a big lever labeled ACTIVATE HIRE ME MODE)_

## Hire Me

Since the mid-2000s I've been working as a software engineer. Most recently, I wrapped up a four-year stint as a Staff Engineer on [Glitch](https://glitch.com), the platform where everyone built the web, at [Fastly](https://fastly.com). Before that I got to work with great people at places like [Discogs](https://discogs.com) and [Vox Media](https://voxmedia.com). I've helped build great products, led teams of engineers, built and maintained public and private APIs, and overall have been very lucky to work with people who made me want to:

- do quality work
- pull off fun tricks
- learn everything necessary for both
- speak up for what's right, and
- advocate for all of _us_ to do all of _that_

My job title usually looks something like "full stack engineer" or "product engineer". My work experience tends toward the backend, especially around the API layer, but I like having the opportunity to keep up to speed (and be helpful) on some amount of frontend development and I appreciate the freedom/autonomy afforded by doing a little bit of infrastructure/ops work as well.

This next bit could maybe sound like some kind of hot air about what a good team player I am but hopefully by writing this disclaimer I'll make it clear that I actually believe this is the important part of what finds me work where I'll be happy and productive:

I like a good technical challenge but I'm of the opinion that the best work I do is the time spent collaborating with product managers, designers, user researchers, and other engineers to make sure we all actually understand the work that we're doing. I think this step, and then rigorously working through a process that translates that understanding into useful changes, is a solid path to good work. Trying to take shortcuts or avoiding the work of understanding is the most common path to high-churn, high-incident, discouraging work.

I hope there's always some amount of coding in my job but the times that I have found the most success I have had a lot of other responsibilities that, in my mind, have to come first: communicating, writing, arguing (respectfully!), presenting, thinking about team structure and processes, and building community among teammates and across teams within a business or partnership. I think if you sacrifice these things, the output of the coding work will either suffer or be limited in its impact.
