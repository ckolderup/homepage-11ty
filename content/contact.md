If you want to get in touch, you can email me at `casey@kolderup.org`.

I'm on public social media networks: Bluesky (@maincharacter.today) and Mastodon (@casey@sharetron.com).

I've also been hanging out on record.club (@casey) and letterboxd (@casey) here and there; feel free to follow me on either of those!

If you need to talk via phone, videoconference, or Signal, start by contacting me via email to make arrangements in advance.
