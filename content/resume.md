## Contact Details

You can email me at `casey@kolderup.org.` If you explain in that email what you're looking for, I'm generally happy to provide more synchronous forms of communication like a phone/SMS number or details for apps like Signal.

## What I'm Looking For

An opportunity to work as a product-focused engineer and senior member of your engineering staff, prototyping new products, maintaining well-established ones, and understanding the business enough to provide technically-minded, user-aware insights to product managers and stakeholders. I want to give your team what it needs: the vibe-improver, the engineer who will actually attend your meetings, the green-field prototyper, the incident manager, or the slightly annoying person you know is right about ethics and user focus. I want to help you make the right decisions that will help you today and also avoid a lot of pain six months from now. [Read more on my website!](/me#hire-me)
